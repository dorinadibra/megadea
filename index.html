							<h2>We believe that...</h2>
							<p>Change takes time, and yet we want it now. Change journey can not be prescribed, and yet processes and clear plans are needed to take an organization from A to B. While change remains a choice, results emerge only when objectives are clearly defined. While the future is still to be determined, only a clear vision of it and a playing to win culture can make all involved people thrive. </p>

											<h3>Lorna Macfadyen</h3>
											<p>Anaida stepped in to help with a difficult situation in a manufacturing site where the roles and responsibilities were not clear, leading to misalignment; where some managers were not fully trained in performance management and where there had been a high turnover in the leadership team, leading to some stress. Within a very short period, Anaida had clarified the key issues to be resolved and engaged the teams very effectively, building trust quickly and deeply. Her logical, sympathetic but rigorous approach turned these situations around within a few months, leading to clarity on roles and responsibilities across the functions and through the many layers in the team; improving the leadership through performance management and building trust across the new team. Anaida very effectively completed her mission here and many thanks to her for her professionalism. </p>

											<h3>Joris Peters</h3>
											<p>Our location, which employees more then 300 employees has embarked in an intensive change journey in the last years. Local leadership team and I decided to revisit our approach to change and create a positive impact with our teams. Anaida's support was focused on three main areas: coaching, performance management, roles & responsibilities. We developed a plan and executed it and as a result the involved teams were able to better understand roles and responsibilities, drive performance and give and receive candid feedback. Great support and right push! </p>
